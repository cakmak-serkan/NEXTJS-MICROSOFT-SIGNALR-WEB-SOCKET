Using SignalR with Next.js allows for real-time web app features like live chat, real-time notifications, and content updates without page refreshing.

To use SignalR with Next.js, you can create a SignalR server in .NET and integrate it with Next.js using the "@microsoft/signalr" npm package. You can then use SignalR methods to send and receive real-time messages from server to client and vice versa.

Integrating SignalR with Next.js allows for powerful and scalable real-time web app development to meet your users' needs.
